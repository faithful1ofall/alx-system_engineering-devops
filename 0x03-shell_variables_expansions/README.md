# Shell, Init Files, Variables, and Expansions

This project consists of a series of shell scripts that cover various aspects of shell scripting, initialization files, variables, and expansions. These scripts are designed to help you understand fundamental concepts related to shell programming. Below is an overview of each task:

## Task 0: Create an Alias

- Script: [0-alias](./0-alias)
- Description: This script creates an alias named `ls` that runs the command `rm *`. It demonstrates how to create and use aliases in a shell.

## Task 1: Hello You

- Script: [1-hello_you](./1-hello_you)
- Description: This script prints "hello user," where "user" is the current Linux user. It showcases how to retrieve and display information about the user.

## Task 2: Add to the PATH

- Script: [2-path](./2-path)
- Description: This script adds the directory `/action` to the end of the `PATH` environment variable. It illustrates how to manipulate the `PATH` variable.

## Task 3: Count Directories in PATH

- Script: [3-paths](./3-paths)
- Description: This script counts the number of directories in the `PATH` environment variable. It demonstrates how to work with environment variable values.

## Task 4: List Environment Variables

- Script: [4-global_variables](./4-global_variables)
- Description: This script lists various environment variables and their values. It provides insights into the system's environment variables.

## Task 5: List Local and Environment Variables

- Script: [5-local_variables](./5-local_variables)
- Description: This script lists both local variables, environment variables, and functions available in the current shell session. It helps understand the scope of variables.

## Task 6: Create a Local Variable

- Script: [6-create_local_variable](./6-create_local_variable)
- Description: This script creates a new local variable named `BEST` with the value "School." It demonstrates the creation of local variables.

## Task 7: Create a Global Variable

- Script: [7-create_global_variable](./7-create_global_variable)
- Description: This script creates a new global variable named `BEST` with the value "School." It showcases how to create global variables.

## Task 8: Perform Arithmetic Operations

- Script: [8-true_knowledge](./8-true_knowledge)
- Description: This script performs an addition operation between the number 128 and the value stored in the `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` environment variable and prints the result.

## Task 9: Divide and Rule

- Script: [9-divide_and_rule](./9-divide_and_rule)
- Description: This script divides the value stored in the `POWER` environment variable by the value stored in the `DIVIDE` environment variable and prints the result.

## Task 10: Exponent of Variables

- Script: [10-love_exponent_breath](./10-love_exponent_breath)
- Description: This script calculates and displays the result of raising the value of `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE`, both stored in environment variables.

## Task 11: Binary to Decimal

- Script: [11-binary_to_decimal](./11-binary_to_decimal)
- Description: This script converts a binary number stored in the `BINARY` environment variable to its decimal equivalent and prints the result.

## Task 12: Combinations of Two Letters

- Script: [12-combinations](./12-combinations)
- Description: This script generates all possible combinations of two lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', except 'oo'. It demonstrates string manipulations.

## Task 13: Print a Floating-Point Number

- Script: [13-print_float](./13-print_float)
- Description: This script prints a number with two decimal places, read from the `NUM` environment variable.

## Task 14: Decimal to Hexadecimal (Advanced)

- Script: [100-decimal_to_hexadecimal](./100-decimal_to_hexadecimal)
- Description: This advanced script converts a decimal number stored in the `DECIMAL` environment variable to its hexadecimal equivalent and prints the result.

## Task 15: Rot13 Encryption (Advanced)

- Script: [101-rot13](./101-rot13)
- Description: This advanced script encodes and decodes text using the rot13 encryption method. It works with ASCII characters.

## Task 16: Print Every Other Line

- Script: [102-odd](./102-odd)
- Description: This script prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line.

## Task 17: Perform Base Conversion (Advanced)

- Script: [103-water_and_stir](./103-water_and_stir)
- Description: This advanced script performs base conversion on two variables, `WATER` and `STIR`, and prints the result in base `bestchol`.

Feel free to explore these scripts and gain a deeper understanding of shell scripting concepts and techniques.
